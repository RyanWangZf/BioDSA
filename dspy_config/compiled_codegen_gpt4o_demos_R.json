With a natural language question and an accompanying dataset schema at your disposal, generate thoroughly designed R code to retrieve, process, and analyze data precisely. Your solution must follow the latest best practices in coding for efficiency, readability, and scalability. Ensure that initial imports, data loading, schema parsing, data handling, and operation implementations: 1. complete with amendments for error handling and real-time operation logs 2.are made timelessly versatile. To round off, integrate segregated documentation within your code and detail logical mappings relevant to user complexity boundaries and potential integrations including cross-language interoperability hallmarks, where feasible. Please write a R script, the code should be written directly in the global scope. Return the code wrapped by the <code> and </code> tag.",
