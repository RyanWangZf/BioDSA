# Research Findings: CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing for Sickle Cell Disease

## Study Overview

This document summarizes the key findings from our Phase I/II clinical trial investigating CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD). The study was conducted at three academic medical centers between 2022-2024.

## Patient Population

- Total enrolled: 45 patients
- Age range: 18-55 years (median: 28 years)
- Gender: 24 female, 21 male
- Disease severity: All patients had severe SCD with ≥2 vaso-occlusive crises per year
- Prior treatments: All patients had failed or were intolerant to hydroxyurea therapy

## Treatment Protocol

Patients underwent the following procedure:
1. Autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells were collected via apheresis
2. Cells were edited ex vivo using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the BCL11A erythroid enhancer
3. Patients received myeloablative conditioning with busulfan
4. Edited cells were reinfused on Day 0

## Efficacy Results

### Primary Endpoint: Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) Levels
- Baseline mean HbF: 5.2% (range: 1.8-12.4%)
- Month 6 mean HbF: 38.7% (range: 28.5-52.1%)
- Month 12 mean HbF: 41.2% (range: 31.0-54.8%)
- Month 24 mean HbF: 40.8% (range: 29.4-53.2%)

### Secondary Endpoints
- Vaso-occlusive crises: 
  - Pre-treatment: median 4.5 events/year
  - Post-treatment: median 0 events/year (p < 0.001)
  
- Transfusion requirements:
  - Pre-treatment: 78% of patients required regular transfusions
  - Post-treatment: 4% required transfusions (2 patients, transient)

- Pain medication usage:
  - Opioid consumption reduced by 89% from baseline

- Quality of life (SF-36):
  - Physical component score improved from 32.4 to 51.2
  - Mental component score improved from 38.1 to 52.8

## Safety Results

### Serious Adverse Events
- Grade 3-4 neutropenia: 100% (expected with myeloablative conditioning)
- Febrile neutropenia: 42%
- Mucositis Grade 3-4: 31%
- Hepatic veno-occlusive disease: 2 patients (4.4%), both resolved
- No treatment-related deaths

### Long-term Safety
- No evidence of off-target editing detected
- No insertional oncogenesis observed
- No clonal expansion of edited cells
- Stable engraftment maintained through 24 months

## Biomarker Analysis

### Hemoglobin Parameters
- Total hemoglobin increased from mean 8.2 g/dL to 11.8 g/dL
- Hemoglobin S levels decreased from 78% to 42%
- Red blood cell morphology normalized in 89% of patients

### Inflammatory Markers
- C-reactive protein decreased by 68%
- Lactate dehydrogenase normalized in 91% of patients
- Bilirubin levels decreased by 54%

## Conclusions

1. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the BCL11A enhancer successfully induced therapeutic levels of fetal hemoglobin
2. Clinical benefits were substantial and durable through 24 months of follow-up
3. Safety profile was acceptable and consistent with myeloablative conditioning
4. This approach represents a potentially curative therapy for sickle cell disease
