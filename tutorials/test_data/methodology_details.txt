# Detailed Methodology: CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing Protocol

## 1. Study Design

### Trial Design
- Open-label, single-arm, Phase I/II study
- Multi-center: 3 academic medical centers in the United States
- Duration: 24-month primary follow-up, 15-year long-term follow-up planned
- ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03745287 (fictional for this example)

### Regulatory Approvals
- FDA IND approval obtained March 2021
- IRB approval at all participating sites
- Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) oversight

### Inclusion Criteria
1. Confirmed diagnosis of sickle cell disease (HbSS or HbSβ0)
2. Age 18-55 years
3. ≥2 vaso-occlusive crises requiring hospitalization in the past 2 years
4. Failed or intolerant to hydroxyurea therapy
5. Adequate organ function (cardiac, hepatic, renal)
6. ECOG performance status 0-1

### Exclusion Criteria
1. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant
2. HIV, HBV, or HCV infection
3. Severe iron overload with cardiac involvement
4. Prior malignancy within 5 years
5. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

## 2. Cell Collection and Processing

### Apheresis Procedure
- Patients received plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg) and G-CSF (10 μg/kg/day x 4 days) for mobilization
- CD34+ cells collected via large-volume leukapheresis
- Target collection: ≥6 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg
- Backup collection stored unedited for rescue if needed

### CD34+ Selection
- CliniMACS system used for CD34+ positive selection
- Purity requirement: ≥90% CD34+
- Viability requirement: ≥85%

## 3. CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing

### Target Site
- BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer region on chromosome 2
- Guide RNA sequence: 5'-CUAACAGUUGCUUUUAUCAC-3'
- This disrupts BCL11A expression specifically in erythroid cells

### Editing Reagents
- Cas9 protein: SpCas9 (Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9), GMP-grade
- sgRNA: Chemically modified synthetic sgRNA with 2'-O-methyl and phosphorothioate modifications
- Electroporation: Lonza 4D-Nucleofector system

### Editing Protocol
1. CD34+ cells thawed and rested for 2 hours
2. Cells resuspended at 1 x 10^7 cells/mL
3. RNP complex (Cas9:sgRNA at 1:2.5 molar ratio) added
4. Electroporation using program EO-100
5. Cells cultured in StemSpan SFEM II + cytokines for 48 hours
6. Quality control testing performed
7. Cells cryopreserved in CryoStor CS10

### Quality Control
- Editing efficiency: Measured by next-generation sequencing (NGS)
- Minimum requirement: ≥70% on-target indels
- Off-target analysis: GUIDE-seq and targeted NGS at top 100 predicted sites
- Sterility testing: 14-day culture
- Endotoxin: <0.5 EU/mL
- Mycoplasma: Negative

## 4. Conditioning Regimen

### Busulfan Protocol
- Pharmacokinetically-adjusted IV busulfan
- Target AUC: 4,000-5,000 μM·min per dose
- Administered on Days -6 to -3
- Seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam

### Supportive Care
- Antiemetics per institutional guidelines
- VOD prophylaxis with ursodiol
- Infection prophylaxis: levofloxacin, fluconazole, acyclovir
- Transfusion support to maintain Hgb >9 g/dL and platelets >20,000/μL

## 5. Infusion and Monitoring

### Cell Infusion
- Day 0: Edited cells thawed at bedside and infused IV over 15-30 minutes
- Target dose: ≥3 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg
- Premedication: diphenhydramine and acetaminophen

### Engraftment Monitoring
- Daily CBC starting Day +1
- Neutrophil engraftment: ANC ≥500/μL for 3 consecutive days
- Platelet engraftment: Platelets ≥20,000/μL without transfusion x 7 days

### Long-term Monitoring
- Monthly visits through Month 6
- Quarterly visits through Month 24
- Annual visits through Year 15
- Assessments: CBC, reticulocyte count, hemoglobin electrophoresis, HbF quantification, LDH, bilirubin

## 6. Statistical Analysis

### Sample Size
- Based on Simon's two-stage design
- H0: Response rate ≤50%, H1: Response rate ≥80%
- Alpha = 0.05, Power = 80%
- Stage 1: 15 patients, Stage 2: 30 additional patients

### Analysis Populations
- Intent-to-treat (ITT): All enrolled patients
- Modified ITT (mITT): All patients who received edited cell infusion
- Safety: All patients who received any study treatment

### Primary Analysis
- HbF response rate at Month 6 (success: HbF ≥20% or HbF increase ≥3-fold)
- 95% confidence intervals calculated using Clopper-Pearson method

### Secondary Analyses
- Time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment: Kaplan-Meier method
- VOC frequency: Negative binomial regression
- QoL: Paired t-test comparing baseline to Month 12
