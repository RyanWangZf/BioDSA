      "  - Must meet organ function criteria and avoid strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers\n",
      "  - Cardiac/QTc and ILD/pneumonitis exclusions need to be checked\n",
      "- Brief rationale:\n",
      "  - This study adds repotrectinib (a next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting bypass resistance pathways) to osimertinib, aiming to overcome resistance after earlier EGFR TKI exposure. It is specifically designed to enroll patients like this after progression on erlotinib/gefitinib/afatinib (without requiring prior osimertinib). High relevance and a favorable inclusion fit.\n",

      "  - ECOG PS 0–2 allowed (patient ECOG 1)\n",
      "- Key concerns:\n",
      "  - If the patient has NOT previously received osimertinib, the protocol requires EGFR T790M negativity to enroll in the resistant cohort; current T790M status is unknown and must be tested\n",
      "  - Requires adequate labs and cardiac/QTc (<500 ms) and excludes ILD/pneumonitis\n",
      "  - Single-site or limited sites may impact logistics (e.g., Emory University, Atlanta, GA)\n",
      "- Brief rationale:\n",
      "  - MRX-2843 (MerTK/FLT3 inhibitor) plus osimertinib is a rational combination to address resistance mechanisms. If T790M is negative (a common scenario in ~40–50% post–first-gen EGFR TKI progressors), this becomes a strong option. If T790M positive, standard-of-care osimertinib is preferred first; trial may then be considered after osimertinib resistance.\n",

      "  - Designed for EGFR-mutant NSCLC after progression on EGFR TKI\n",

      "  - HER3 is commonly upregulated in EGFR-mutant, TKI-resistant disease; HER3-DXd has shown activity across resistance mechanisms\n",
      "- Key concerns:\n",
      "  - Dose-escalation cohort requires the patient to be currently receiving erlotinib/gefitinib/afatinib/osimertinib with radiologic progression while on therapy and able to discontinue; if erlotinib has already been stopped, eligibility may be uncertain\n",
      "  - If treated with a first- or second-generation TKI (erlotinib), the study requires absence of T790M for enrollment in certain cohorts; T790M status is unknown and must be tested\n",
      "  - Expansion cohorts generally require prior chemotherapy; the patient has not had platinum chemotherapy, so expansion cohorts are likely not applicable\n",
      "  - Excludes ILD/pneumonitis and significant cardiac/QTc issues; corneal disease exclusion applies\n",
      "- Brief rationale:\n",
      "  - HER3-DXd is a promising ADC for EGFR-mutant NSCLC after EGFR TKI resistance. If she qualifies for the dose-escalation cohort (e.g., if still on erlotinib at screening with documented progression and T790M negative), this could offer targeted benefit irrespective of specific resistance pathways.\n",

      "  - ILD/pneumonitis, cardiovascular, and QTc exclusions require screening\n",
      "- Brief rationale:\n",
      "  - Amivantamab (EGFR/MET bispecific) is important in EGFR-mutant disease. However, without prior osimertinib and with prior erlotinib, current cohorts likely do not fit. Could be reconsidered if she receives osimertinib and later progresses.\n",

      "  - High potential utility after osimertinib resistance; not applicable now but could be valuable if she later receives osimertinib and progresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary of top recommendations and caveats:\n",
      "- Top trials to discuss now:\n",
      "  1) NCT04772235 (Repotrectinib + Osimertinib): Best immediate fit after progression on erlotinib, without requiring prior osimertinib; high relevance and strong likelihood of eligibility if organ function and cardiac/ILD criteria are met and tissue biopsy is feasible.\n",
      "  2) NCT04762199 (MRX-2843 + Osimertinib): Very relevant; eligibility hinges on EGFR T790M being negative if she has not received osimertinib. Order EGFR resistance testing (tissue or plasma) to determine T790M status.\n",
      "  3) NCT03260491 (HER3-DXd/Patritumab deruxtecan): Promising option in EGFR-mutant NSCLC post-TKI; eligibility depends on enrollment to a dose-escalation cohort (often requires being on a TKI with progression and T790M negative in some settings). Clarify current erlotinib status and T790M result.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Immediate next steps:\n",
      "  - Obtain resistance testing (plasma ctDNA and/or tissue) to determine EGFR T790M status and check for other resistance mechanisms (e.g., MET amplification). T790M positivity would support starting standard-of-care osimertinib promptly; T790M negativity would strengthen eligibility for NCT04762199 and NCT04772235.\n",
      "  - Confirm measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and ensure recent imaging.\n",
      "  - Review cardiac (ECG/QTc) and pulmonary history to exclude ILD/pneumonitis; verify organ function labs.\n",
      "  - Confirm willingness and feasibility of a fresh biopsy if required (particularly for NCT04772235).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Future options if she receives osimertinib and later progresses:\n",
      "  - NCT06417814 (Dato-DXd ± Osimertinib vs chemo)\n",
      "  - Amivantamab-based trials post-osimertinib (e.g., NCT05498428 relevant cohorts)\n",
      "  - MET-directed combinations if resistance testing reveals MET amplification (e.g., Lung-MAP S1900G, NCT05642572; or amivantamab-SC in MET amplification, NCT06116682 but note exclusions for concurrent actionable EGFR).\n",
      "\n",
      "Important caveats:\n",
      "- Many first-line osimertinib trials (e.g., NCT04410796; NCT03586453; NCT04181060; NCT07058519) exclude patients with prior EGFR TKI therapy in the metastatic setting. Given her prior erlotinib, these are likely ineligible now.\n",
      "- The best therapeutic course outside trials remains guided by resistance testing:\n",
      "  - If T790M positive: initiate osimertinib as standard-of-care and consider trials after progression.\n",
      "  - If T790M negative: clinical trial participation is attractive; otherwise, platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy is standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please discuss the top 3 trials (NCT04772235, NCT04762199, NCT03260491) with your oncologist, alongside prompt resistance testing to clarify EGFR T790M status and any other resistance alterations (e.g., MET amplification) which can further tailor trial selection.\n"
