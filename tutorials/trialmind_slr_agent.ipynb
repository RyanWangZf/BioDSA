      "    - Long-term: no new late-onset toxicities observed at 5 years in the trial cohort.\n",
      "- Quality of evidence: Low-to-moderate overall due to heterogeneity (trial vs real-world), single-arm designs, retrospective bias, and incomplete reporting of some outcomes. No quantitative pooling was feasible.\n",
      "- Implications: CD19 CAR-T therapy yields substantial responses in R/R aggressive B-cell lymphoma; a meaningful subset achieves durable remission, particularly those achieving early CR. Safety is manageable but includes significant risks for severe CRS and neurotoxicity, necessitating experienced centers and vigilant monitoring. Patient selection (e.g., tumor burden, LDH) may influence outcomes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse/large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL/LBCL) and other aggressive subtypes, have historically poor outcomes after failure of chemoimmunotherapy. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies (e.g., axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel, lisocabtagene maraleucel, brexucabtagene autoleucel) have transformed the therapeutic landscape by inducing high response rates and offering the possibility of durable remissions. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to synthesize the efficacy and safety of CAR-T therapy in adults with R/R B-cell lymphoma and to highlight clinical implications and evidence gaps.\n",
