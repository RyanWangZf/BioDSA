Additionally, BioPlanet terms _SHC1 events in ERBB2 signaling_ (overlapping ERBB4, ERBB2, KRAS, HRAS) and _FRS2-mediated cascade_ (overlapping KRAS, FGFR4, HRAS, FGFR2) support ERBB and FGFR adaptor-mediated linkage to RAS-MAPK._Enrichment evidence_ GO molecular function enrichment identified transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity and transmembrane receptor protein kinase activity as significant for the gene set including ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR2, FGFR4, HRAS, KRAS, consistent with ERBB and FGFR family members acting as upstream receptor tyrosine kinases that initiate downstream signaling including MAPK._Interaction evidence_ Protein-protein interaction results show ERBB2 interacts with GRB2 and SHC1, and ERBB4 interacts with SHC1, consistent with recruitment of adaptor proteins that couple RTKs to RAS activation via SOS. HRAS interacts with SOS1 and RAF1, and KRAS interacts with RAF1 and SHOC2, consistent with activated RAS propagating signals to the RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK cascade._Gene-level evidence_ ERBB2 (NCBI Gene) is an epidermal growth factor receptor family receptor tyrosine kinase that enhances activation of downstream pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase. ERBB4 (NCBI Gene) encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by neuregulins that induces mitogenesis and differentiation. FGFR2 (NCBI Gene) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds FGFs and triggers downstream cascades influencing mitogenesis. FGFR4 (NCBI Gene) is a receptor tyrosine kinase for FGFs involved in regulating proliferation and differentiation. HRAS and KRAS (NCBI Gene) are small GTPases functioning in signal transduction, acting downstream to relay signals to RAF-MEK-ERK._Literature evidence linking ERBBs to RAS-MAPK_PMID_ 28781955 ErbB2 signaling epigenetically suppresses microRNA-205 transcription via the Ras_Raf_MEK_ERK pathway in breast cancer, directly supporting ERBB2 engagement of the RAS-MAPK cascade._PMID_ 40289214 GRB2 promotes brain metastasis in HER2-positive breast cancer by regulating the Ras_MAPK pathway, implicating HER2_ERBB2 with adaptor GRB2 in activating the RAS-MAPK pathway._PMID_ 18335053 Topological analysis indicates EGFR_ErbB4 heterodimers preferentially engage Grb2-SOS to drive Ras activation leading to ERK signaling, supporting ERBB4 as an upstream activator of Ras_MAPK._Literature evidence linking FGFRs to RAS-MAPK_PMID_ 15863030 Cellular signaling by FGFRs shows that FGFR stimulation phosphorylates docking proteins (FRS2_), which mediate activation of the Ras_MAPK pathway, consistent with FGFR2 and FGFR4 acting upstream of Ras-MAPK._PMID_ 25053532 Review of FGFRs states FGFRs regulate tumorigenesis through main pathways including RAS-MAPK, consistent with FGFR2 and FGFR4 upstream of RAS-MAPK signaling._PMID_ 23696246 Review on FGFs reiterates that FGF signaling drives the RAS-MAPK branch; FGFR2 and FGFR4 are included among FGFRs signaling to RAS-MAPK._PMID_ 40170241 FGFR2 abrogation reduces MAPK pathway activation and intercepts KRAS-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis, indicating FGFR2 contributes upstream input to KRAS-MAPK signaling in vivo._Overall assessment_ Multiple independent lines of evidence from pathway databases (KEGG, BioPlanet), gene function summaries (NCBI Gene), protein interactions (GRB2_SHC1 with ERBBs; SOS1_RAF with RAS), and peer-reviewed studies support that ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR2, and FGFR4 are upstream receptor tyrosine kinases that, via adaptor proteins like SHC1, FRS2, and GRB2-SOS, activate RAS isoforms (including HRAS and KRAS) to propagate mitogenic RAS-MAPK signaling.\n",
