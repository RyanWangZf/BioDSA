The following is a multi-choice question.

Question: What are the relative benefits and harms of using inotropes for the prevention of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) and mortality in paediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease?

Options:
A. Levosimendan likely results in a large reduction in mortality and LCOS compared to placebo, but may increase the duration of mechanical ventilation and adverse events.
B. Milrinone likely results in no difference in mortality, but likely reduces LCOS and may increase the duration of mechanical ventilation and adverse events compared to placebo.
C. Dobutamine's effect on mortality is unknown, but it likely reduces the length of hospital stay and has no significant effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation compared to placebo.
D. All inotropes result in a significant reduction in mortality and LCOS, with no increase in adverse events or duration of mechanical ventilation compared to placebo.
